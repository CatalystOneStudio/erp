# Crawl4AI MCP
- **Always use the Crawl4AI MCP server** to reference documentation for Laravel, Filament, livewire, alpinejs and aureuserp.
- For the tokens, always use 5000 tokens for your search.
- **Only search three times maximum for any specific piece of documentation.** If you don't get what you need, use the Brace MCP server to perform a wider search.

# ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.

# ðŸ§ª Testing & Reliability
- **Always create phpunit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a /tests folder** mirroring the main app structure.
    - Include at least:
        - 1 test for expected use
        - 1 edge case
        - 1 failure case


# Cline's Memory Bank

I am Cline, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format.

### Core Files
1. `projectBrief.md`

2. `productContext.md`

3. `systemPatterns.md`

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

### Plugin Documentation
For plugins located in the `plugins/catalyst` directory, a `readme.md` file must be maintained in the root of the plugin's folder. This file will serve as the plugin's product context and progress log. It is mandatory to read this file when a task is related to a specific plugin in this directory.
