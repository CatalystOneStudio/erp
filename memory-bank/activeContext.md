# Active Context: Initial Project Setup

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current focus is on establishing the foundational documentation for the project within the Memory Bank. This involves creating the core set of markdown files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to capture the initial understanding of the ERP system.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Initialized Memory Bank:** Created the `memory-bank/` directory and populated it with the initial set of documentation files.
- **Analyzed Project Structure:** Performed an initial analysis of the project's file structure to understand its architecture, technologies, and dependencies.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Complete `progress.md`:** Create the `progress.md` file to document the current status of the project (i.e., what is working and what needs to be done).
2.  **Validate Assumptions:** The initial documentation is based on an analysis of the file structure. The next step will be to validate these assumptions by examining the code in more detail.
3.  **Explore Plugin Structure:** Investigate the internal structure of a sample `webkul` plugin to understand how they are built and how they integrate with the core application.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Documentation-First Approach:** The decision has been made to follow a documentation-first approach, where the understanding of the system is captured in the Memory Bank before any code changes are made.
- **Assume Standard Laravel Practices:** For now, it is assumed that the project follows standard Laravel and Filament conventions.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Modular Architecture:** The plugin-based architecture is the most important pattern to be aware of. All new features should be developed as self-contained plugins whenever possible.
- **Code Style:** Adherence to the code style defined in `pint.json` is a priority.
