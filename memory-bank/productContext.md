# Product Context: Unified Business Management Platform

## 1. Problem Space

Businesses, especially small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), often struggle with managing disparate systems for different operations (e.g., one for accounting, another for inventory, a third for sales). This fragmentation leads to data silos, inefficiencies, and a lack of a single source of truth, making it difficult to get a holistic view of the business.

## 2. Vision & Solution

This ERP system aims to solve these problems by providing a single, integrated platform to manage core business processes. By unifying data and workflows, the system will empower businesses to streamline operations, improve data accuracy, and make better-informed decisions.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience is SMEs that require a flexible, customizable, and cost-effective solution to manage their operations. The multi-panel architecture also suggests a need to serve both internal employees (admins) and external stakeholders (customers).

## 4. User Experience Goals

- **Unified & Consistent:** Provide a seamless and consistent user experience across all modules.
- **Intuitive:** The interface, powered by Filament, should be modern, clean, and easy to navigate for non-technical users.
- **Role-Based Access:** Ensure that users only see the information and tools relevant to their roles, enhancing security and reducing complexity.
- **Extensible:** Allow for the addition of new features and modules without disrupting existing workflows.
