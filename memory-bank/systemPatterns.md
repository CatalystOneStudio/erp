# System Patterns: Modular and Service-Driven Architecture

## 1. Core Architectural Model

The system is built upon a **modular monolith** architecture. While it operates as a single application, its internal structure is divided into discrete, independent plugins. This approach combines the deployment simplicity of a monolith with the maintainability and scalability of a microservices-like design.

## 2. Key Design Patterns

- **Plugin Architecture:** The primary pattern is the use of self-contained plugins located in `plugins/webkul/`. Each plugin encapsulates a specific business domain (e.g., `products`, `sales`, `invoices`) and includes its own routes, controllers, models, and views.
    - **Discovery:** It is assumed that the core application discovers and registers these plugins at runtime, likely through a service provider mechanism.

- **Service Provider Model:** Laravel's Service Providers are likely used extensively to register plugin services, routes, and other resources with the main application. Each plugin probably has its own `PluginServiceProvider`.

- **Repository Pattern:** (Assumed) Given the complexity of an ERP, it's likely that a repository pattern is used to abstract the data layer, promoting a separation of concerns between business logic and data access.

- **Multi-Tenancy (Potential):** While not explicitly confirmed, ERP systems often require multi-tenancy. The architecture should be evaluated for this possibility. The presence of a `CustomerPanelProvider` might also hint at this.

## 3. Component Relationships

- **Core Application:** The `app/` directory contains the core application logic, which acts as the central orchestrator. It provides the foundational services and bootstraps the plugins.
- **Plugins:** The `plugins/` directory contains the feature modules. These are loosely coupled with the core application and potentially with each other.
- **Admin Panels:** The `app/Providers/Filament/` directory defines the Filament admin panels. These panels consume services and data from the core application and the plugins to build the user interface.

## 4. Critical Implementation Paths

- **Plugin Registration:** Understanding how plugins are registered and booted is critical for adding new modules or modifying existing ones. This is likely handled in a core service provider or a dedicated plugin manager.
- **Data Flow:** Tracing the flow of data between plugins and the core application is essential for understanding business processes.
- **Permissions & Access Control:** The integration with `filament-shield` and `spatie/laravel-permission` is a critical path for ensuring system security.
