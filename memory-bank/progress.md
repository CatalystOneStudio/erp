# Project Progress: Baseline Established

## 1. What Works

- **Application Skeleton:** The basic Laravel application structure is in place.
- **Core Dependencies:** Key dependencies like Filament, Spatie Permission, and Webkul plugins are included in `composer.json`.
- **Initial Migrations:** The database schema includes initial tables for users, jobs, cache, and permissions.
- **Admin Panel Providers:** The Filament admin and customer panel providers are set up.

## 2. What's Left to Build

This is a baseline project. The vast majority of functionality is yet to be implemented or verified. Key areas include:

- **Business Logic:** The actual implementation within each Webkul plugin needs to be reviewed and potentially customized.
- **Filament Resources:** The Filament resources, pages, and widgets for each module need to be created.
- **Frontend Implementation:** The customer-facing frontend (if any) is not yet defined.
- **Testing:** A comprehensive test suite needs to be developed.
- **Deployment:** A deployment pipeline and production environment need to be set up.

## 3. Current Status

The project is at the **initial setup and analysis** phase. The application can likely be installed and run, but it does not yet have any meaningful functionality beyond what is provided by the default packages.

## 4. Known Issues

- **Unverified Assumptions:** All analysis is based on file structure and has not been verified by running the application or inspecting the code in detail.
- **Missing Configuration:** The `.env` file is not configured, so the application cannot be run without manual setup.
- **Plugin Integrity:** The state and functionality of the `webkul` plugins are unknown.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Decision:** The project has been started with a modular architecture based on Webkul plugins.
- **Next Decision Point:** The next major decision will be to either adopt the Webkul plugins as-is or to begin customizing or replacing them to fit specific business requirements. This decision will depend on a more detailed analysis of their functionality.
